Monero "BADCACA" tracking project
Monero doesn't work. There is a dozen of known ways to track it.
Did you use Monero yesterday? If so, check the list below, you might be on it.

TLDR: Monero was never a real privacy coin. Multiple problems that Ciphertrace is currently exploiting were reported to Monero project in 2016 and remain unfixed since. To draw attention to the issue I will publish transactions, IP addresses and porn preferences of 100 "lucky" Monero users every day.


Who are you? Why are you doing this?

I will let needmoney90 (Monero moderator), anonimal (Monero developer) and dsc (Monero developer) introduce me:
Yes, Monero community is full of lovely, lovely people. And that's not even counting neo-Nazis üòí

I have been logging Monero transactions for over a year now. Main reason why I decided to go public are blatant lies that there is nothing to worry about Ciphertrace and that Monero is private. If you are prepared to sit though an 8 hour lecture on how broken Monero is, you will see that even they admit it. However that's obviously a small percentage of people they sell Monero to.


Didn't Monero academics make a video series saying "Monero doesn't work, sorry, lol"?

Yes. Most likely they had to because they feared legal repercussions. In any case, if you are prepared to sit through a 5 hour lecture (who isn't, right?) - it is here.


Why does Monero insist that Ciphertrace has no way of tracking it when in fact such problems were reported and remain unfixed since 2016?

For the same reason why asbestos companies insisted that asbestos is safe, or why big tobacco pumped billions into cool advertising. There is a lot of money to be made, and the top echelons of Monero community stand to make this money. At the end of the day, just like big tobacco, they don't give a damn about the fate of end users. By that time they are laughing all the way to the bank.


I heard that DOJ/IRS/CIA is offering a reward. Is the past data on Monero users or the tracking code for sale?

Yes, over a year worth of logs and the source code is available for sale. If you have experience in government procurment and want to team up, please contact me on contact@monero-badcaca.net.


Is Monero community a cult?

I tend to dislike the word "cult". It implies a religious organisation, whereas MMLs and fringe political groups use the same methods of manipluation.

With regards to Monero it is impossible to say if people that wish "my mother was our lord's groupie" or crowning themselves as "easily the most prestigious coin" are genuine, or just stroking egos in hopes of moving up the community ladder. However, Monero community has a lot of cult-like characteristics, including a bottom caste of people that sacrifice their time and money for "magical crypto friendship" (Riccardo Spagni is pretty much mocking them with his podcast series). And of course insider doctrine - Do you want to hear about Monero's Lord and saviour of NASA, Howard Chu?


I'm a Monero community member and this website makes me angry.

Do you think Vincent Rijmen exploded with anger when AES was broken? No, he congratulated the authors. You have to ask yourself a question. Are you here because you care about privacy coin ecosystem, or are you here to sell your bag of Monero to a greater fool, no matter the consequences? If you truly care about the whole ecosystem, then surely Monero developers are unwilling or unable to fix 4-year-old problems, then perhaps it is time for Monero to go the way of Old Yeller.

Of course this doesn't explain why you are probably venting your anger on Reddit / Twitter as we speak. This is because you feel personally attacked. Even though I don't know you or even your name. So why do you feel personally attacked? The primary objective of a cult is to replace individual identity with a collective one. You will feel that every attack on the cult is an attack on you, and that the cult exploiting your time and money is for the greater good. Well done. You are a "magical crypto friend" now. Now go and buy Riccardo another $750,000 watch while he makes another shitcoin for suckers like you.


What Monero tracking methods Ciphertrace is likely using?

There are 4 separate Monero tracking methods that I know of. Here are the articles:
Hiding your IP while using Ryo or other Cryptonotes (you might want to read that one extra carefully üòÅ)
Tracing Cryptonote ring signatures using external metadata
How buying pot with Monero will get you busted ‚Äî Knacc attack on Cryptonote coins
On-chain tracking of Monero and other Cryptonotes


Did you report the privacy problems to Monero? What happened?

I got banned by Justin Ehrenhofer (SamsungGalaxyPlayer) for being "disruptive" [source]


Is this the end of Monero?

I don't think so. In the same way that Elon Musk did not end flat-earthers, Monero will carry on. Its bottom tiers are too psychologically invested to do anything else. Its top tiers already jettisoned Monero for future projects like Tari, so my prediction is that it will go out with a whimper rather than a bang.


How are you tracking people's IP addresses? Didn't Monero implement Dandelion++ to prevent that?

Similarly to Monero, Dandelion++ is only private on paper.


I didn't download child pornography! You must remove my IP address immediately!

Feel free to explain to your local police why your IP address is streaming those torrents. I don't give a damn.


Do you track cake wallet transactions?

No, transactions on cake wallet are visible only to remote nodes providing service for cake wallet. Of course that means that they know who you are.


Why 100? Why not 10 or 1000?

I think 100-a-day is the golden ratio between showing that I can repeatedly deanonymise Monero users and wholesale disclosure of private data. Mind you, 90% of transactions on Monero network are not very interesting (pool or exchange payouts). My daily pool of 100 is drawn from the remaning 10%


Do you think talking about social issues in Monero will detract from your findings?

I don't think so. People finding their own transactions here is all the validation that I want. On the contrary, I think having an honest discussion with new users about how crypto communities can be psychologically manipulative is very important.



REDDIT

Monero "BADCACA" deanonymization project. Daily list of 100 Monero users and their porn habits. Are you on it?
TLDR
Monero was never a real privacy coin. Multiple problems that Ciphertrace is currently exploiting were reported to Monero project in 2016 and remain unfixed since. To draw attention to the issue we will publish transactions, IP addresses and porn preferences of 100 "lucky" Monero users every day.

Why is there a gaggle of angry redditors responding to BADCACA posts? Why are moderators so desperate to remove this list?
Because they care about your privacy lol. Ok, really they just want to sell you their Monero, and "Our privacy coin is so private that an Internet rando knows what porn you download" doesn't really sell Monero.
