Monero "BADCACA" tracking project
Monero's main selling point is privacy. That promise doesn't work, 'cause there are several ways to track it. 
Did you use Monero yesterday? If so, check the list below, you might be on it.

TLDR: Monero was never a real privacy coin. Multiple problems, that Ciphertrace is currently exploiting, were reported to Monero project in 2016 and remain unfixed since. To draw attention to the issue I will publish transactions, IP addresses and porn preferences of 100 "lucky" Monero users every day.


Who are you? 

I will let needmoney90 (Monero moderator), anonimal (Monero developer) and dsc (Monero developer) introduce me:
Yes, Monero community is full of lovely, lovely people. 


Why are you doing this? 

I have been logging Monero transactions for over a year now. Main reason why I decided to go public are blatant lies, that there is nothing to worry about Ciphertrace and that Monero is private. If you are prepared to sit though an 8 hour lecture on how broken Monero is, you will see that even they admit it. However that's obviously a small percentage of people they sell Monero to.


Didn't Monero academics make a video series called <BreakingMonero>, saying "Monero doesn't work, sorry, lol"?

Yes. Most likely they had to because they feared legal repercussions. In any case, if you are prepared to sit through an 8 hour lecture (who isn't, right?) - it is here. [This is a small contradiction and could diminish credibility, cause above you are talking about 8 hours, now it's 5]


Why does Monero insist that Ciphertrace has no way of tracking it, when in fact such problems were reported and remain unfixed since 2016?

For the same reason why asbestos companies insisted, that asbestos is safe. The same reason big tobacco pumped billions into cool advertising. There is a lot of money to be made and the top echelons of Monero community stand to make this money. At the end of the day, just like big tobacco, they don't give a damn about the fate of end users. And that compromised privacy, makes you a target by big governments and the establishment. 


I heard that DOJ/IRS/CIA [every abbreviation could get a LINK forwarding to an explanation, like https://www.justice.gov/ https://www.irs.gov/ https://www.cia.gov/redirects/ciaredirect.html - probably not necessary for CIA] is offering a reward. Is the past data on Monero users or the tracking code for sale?

Yes, over a year worth of logs and the source code is available for sale. If you have experience in government procurement and want to team up, please contact me on contact@monero-badcaca.net.


Is Monero community a cult?

I tend to dislike the word "cult". It implies a religious organisation, whereas MLM's (Multi-level Marketing) [- you could also work with a link again https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/multi-level-marketing.asp] and fringe political groups use the same methods of manipluation.

Do you want to hear about Monero's Lord and saviour of NASA, Howard Chu and its insider doctrine? With regards to Monero it is impossible to say if people that wish their mother was Howard Chu's groupie or crowning themselves as "easily the most prestigious coin" are genuine. Or are they just stroking egos in hopes of moving up the community ladder? However, Monero community has a lot of cult-like characteristics. This includes a bottom caste of people, that sacrifice their time and money for "magical crypto friendship" (Riccardo Spagni is pretty much mocking them with his podcast series). 


I'm a Monero community member and this website makes me angry.

Do you think Vincent Rijmen exploded with anger when AES was broken? No, he congratulated the authors. You have to ask yourself a question. Are you here because you care about privacy coin ecosystem? Or are you here to sell your bag of Monero to a greater fool, no matter the consequences? If you truly care about the whole ecosystem, you should ask yourself, why are Monero developers unwilling or unable to fix 4-year-old problems? And if those problems persist, maybe then it is time for Monero to go the way of Old Yeller.

Of course this doesn't explain why you are probably venting your anger on Reddit / Twitter or else. Do you feel personally attacked? Even though I don't know you, not even your name. So why do you feel that anger? The primary objective of a cult is to replace individual identity with a collective one. You will feel that every attack on the cult is an attack on you, and that the cult exploiting your time and money is for the greater good. Well done, "magical crypto friend". Now go and buy Riccardo another $750,000 watch, while he makes another shitcoin for manipulated suckers like you. [sucker wd be the angry-hissy tone. you were refering to ;)]


What Monero tracking methods Ciphertrace is likely using?

There are 4 separate Monero tracking methods, that I know of. Here are the articles:
Hiding your IP while using Ryo or other Cryptonotes (you might want to read that one extra carefully üòÅ)
Tracing Cryptonote ring signatures using external metadata
How buying pot with Monero will get you busted ‚Äî Knacc attack on Cryptonote coins
On-chain tracking of Monero and other Cryptonotes


Did you report the privacy problems to Monero? What happened?

I got banned by Justin Ehrenhofer (SamsungGalaxyPlayer) for being "disruptive" [source]


Is this the end of Monero?

I don't think so. In the same way that Elon Musk did not end flat-earthers, Monero will carry on. Its bottom tiers are too psychologically invested to do anything else. Its top tiers already jettisoned Monero for future projects like Tari, so my prediction is that it will go out with a whimper rather than a bang.


How are you tracking people's IP addresses? Didn't Monero implement Dandelion++ to prevent that?

Similarly to Monero, Dandelion++ is only private on paper. [Wd be nice to link a source here]


I didn't download child pornography! You must remove my IP address immediately!

Feel free to explain to your local police, why your IP address is streaming those torrents. I don't give a damn.


Do you track cake wallet transactions?

No, transactions on cake wallet are visible only to remote nodes providing service for cake wallet. Of course that means, that they know who you are.


Why 100? Why not 10 or 1000?

I think 100-a-day is the golden ratio between showing, that I can repeatedly deanonymise Monero users and wholesale disclosure of private data. Mind you, 90% of transactions on Monero network are not very interesting (pool or exchange payouts). My daily pool of 100 is drawn from the remaning 10%


Do you think talking about social issues in Monero will detract from your findings?

I don't think so. People finding their own transactions here is all the validation that I want. On the contrary, I think having an honest discussion with new users about how crypto communities can be psychologically manipulative is very important.


Why am I hearing, that Monero is broken from an outsider and not from Monero developers?

It all boils down to greed. Maybe Monero, the community and the movement was about privacy in the beginning. The need and advantages of private cryptos are till today persistent. Privacy should be a fundamental right and one of the main characteritics of a functioning currency. 
But down the road big problems were discovered with Monero. Serious problems no one had a satisfying answer to. Listen to the podcast <BreakingMonero> [https://www.monerooutreach.org/breaking-monero/], with the intention to mitigate legal implications. 
Identifying security problems is not the issue. But doing nothing about it and attacking people addressing it is. Just keep the party going and the money flowing by selling a broken product to the gullible and uneducated. Also deflect from the failure of your promises by viciously attacking other projects. 

[It is getting to long so I wd leave this out -> Now, shut it all down and risk to loose money, reputation and coinmarketcap-ranking or keep the party going? Of course, they chose poorly. Biiiiitconnnneeeeeeeeeeeect, comes to mind, the last one turns off the lights. ]


Could Monero be an NSA/(or other intelligence agency) honey pot and how do the rumours about Fluffy and Alphabay support that theory?

First, everything is possible. 

And nah, my personal feel of the guy is, that he is what he says he is (a pump and dump scammer, that happened to be in the right place at the right time).

‚ÄúI thought, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to pump it and dump it,‚Äô because I was interested and taking the ideas and implementing them in bitcoin. The bitcoin code base was far more interesting to me than monero, and I thought, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going to work on this codebase, it‚Äôs terrible,'‚Äù he recalls. - fluffypony aka Riccardo Spagni on Monero
https://www.coindesk.com/drugs-code-icos-moneros-long-road-blockchain-mainstream
On the other hand when you look at the Monero-price-history, you see a correlation of Moneros first real pump, when their much-touted FluffyPony announced the adoption by a drugs market called Alphabay. 
Coincidentally it was taken down by law enforcement a few months later. 


Are you a cultist, who doesn't want to believe me? Try that:

Ask Monero community and Monero developers about those vulnerabilities. Let me guess the answer is always "already debunked".
What happens when you point out the specific references being made on my site? Do you get banned as well?

Further questions that come up my mind regarding that topic: [don't know if you want to include them or not]

We are in need for private cryptos? Monero can't live up to its promise. What would be the best alternatives in your opinion?

What is your opinion on Zcash?
What is your opinion on Grim?
What is your opinion on Bitcoins coinjoin?
What is your opinion on the privacy integrated feature at handcash BSV wallet?
What is your opinion on optional privacy Dash - Digital Cash is offering over his paid service-masternode-network?
What is your opinion on Verge, Horizon?


Do you want to give us a best-pratice approach to private crypto transactions with the technology available today?


paragraph 1: [a dozen? is that true? one FAQ down below speaks about 4 ways, that you know and refering to the articles]

q1 who are you: [not that I care, but I wd erase the last phrase. Everybody is nowadays a neo-nazi. Today we have WSB - wallstreetbets smeared as far right-wing antisemites by the establishment. The problem is, at least for me, by inflating the accusations that some people are far-right or neo-nazis, people expect the opposite and credibility could suffer from people accusing others to be far-right. And I don't know about the imgur-pic. Of course your accusations could be true. But this pic solely is no proof imo. but maybe I am missing sth]

q1 + q2: [you could split those 2 questions, to bring more order in]

Feel free to tip a beer, if you like what I am doing. [emoj like that on http://178.254.23.111/~pub/Dash/Dash_Info.html]
If you really dislike the appalling cult-like Monero community, with all their lies and smears, consider becoming a crowd-supporter. 
The money donated can be used 
  1) to run google ads on monero queries,
  2) to increase the number of nodes by 10x (hosting cost is around 100/mo)
  3) to intercept other wallets apart from monero-gui-wallet, that are not hardcoded (closed source) [don't know if closed source is a synonym for hardcoded - but from my perspective this term could be better perceived by non-tech people. Most of them have heard the term open-source]
