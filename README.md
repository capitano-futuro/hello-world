Monero "BADCACA" tracking project
Monero doesn't work. There is a dozen of known ways to track it.
Did you use Monero yesterday? If so, check the list below, you might be on it.

TLDR: Monero was never a real privacy coin. Multiple problems that Ciphertrace is currently exploiting were reported to Monero project in 2016 and remain unfixed since. To draw attention to the issue I will publish transactions, IP addresses and porn preferences of 100 "lucky" Monero users every day.


Who are you? Why are you doing this?

I will let needmoney90 (Monero moderator), anonimal (Monero developer) and dsc (Monero developer) introduce me:
Yes, Monero community is full of lovely, lovely people. And that's not even counting neo-Nazis ðŸ˜’

I have been logging Monero transactions for over a year now. Main reason why I decided to go public are blatant lies that there is nothing to worry about Ciphertrace and that Monero is private. If you are prepared to sit though an 8 hour lecture on how broken Monero is, you will see that even they admit it. However that's obviously a small percentage of people they sell Monero to.


Didn't Monero academics make a video series saying "Monero doesn't work, sorry, lol"?

Yes. Most likely they had to because they feared legal repercussions. In any case, if you are prepared to sit through a 5 hour lecture (who isn't, right?) - it is here.


Why does Monero insist that Ciphertrace has no way of tracking it when in fact such problems were reported and remain unfixed since 2016?
